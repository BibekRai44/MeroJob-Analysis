In this repository, I have analyzed Nepali Job posting platform [Mero Job](https://merojob.com) IT and Telecommunication category.

I have used python Beautiful soup library for web scraping and the data are saved on csv file.

For Analysis,I have done EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis),Data Visualization and  built some  Machine Learning model for predictive results like linear regression and k means clustering.

Python Libraries like numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,sklearn are used for Analysis.
